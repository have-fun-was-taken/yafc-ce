- Be sure that you are using the latest version of YAFC
- Try to remove outdated and disabled mods from your mod folder. Otherwise, you may still make a report, but you need to attach the whole contents of your mod folder, including all outdated and disabled mods.
- Specify the YAFC and Factorio version.
- While YAFC should work with mods down to Factorio 0.17 and maybe even earlier, we actively support only the latest stable versions.
- Attach a new game save file so it's possible to sync the mods with yours.
