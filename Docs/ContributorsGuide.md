# Contributor's Guide

To make your experience better, there are a couple of things to keep in mind when working on a Pull Request: 

Coding phase:
* Please use the same code style as the rest of the codebase. 
* Please prioritize maintainability. Aim for understandable code without dirty hacks.
* Please document the code. If you can also document the existing code, we would be thankful. Better documentation allows others to understand the code faster and thus to contribute more.
* In a programmers' haven, there's a spot for devs who write tests.

PR preparation phase:
* When making a Pull Request, give as much context as possible. 
* If there's no corresponding issue, then describe what the problem was and how your PR fixes it. For instance, context, state without the fix, state with the fix. 
* Make meaningful commit messages. The easier it is to understand your PR, the faster it will be merged.
* If you feel fancy, reorganize your commits - separate and squash them into logical steps, so they are understood even better.
